Spring Framework Autowiring (without Spring Boot):

I. Introduction & Setup

Goal: Explain Spring autowiring using XML configuration.

Adds a Computer interface and Desktop class; Laptop also implements Computer.

Developer class is refactored to depend on Computer, not Laptop.

II. XML Configuration & Injection

Refactoring breaks previous XML config due to constructor changes.

XML is updated to inject Computer using <property ref="labOne"/>.

Adds a second bean deskOne to demonstrate switching implementations.

Highlights potential issues when bean IDs match property names.

III. Autowiring

Introduces autowiring to simplify manual XML wiring.

autowire="byName" injects based on matching bean ID and property name.

autowire="byType" injects based on matching class type.

Conflicts arise with multiple matching beans; resolved using primary="true".

IV. Bean Retrieval

Shows using getBean(Class.class) instead of getBean("id") for simpler access.

V. Summary & Direction

Recaps benefits and limitations of autowiring.

Announces move to annotation-based Spring Boot in future content.

Key Concepts

Interface-based programming for loose coupling

XML-based DI configuration

Autowiring mechanisms: byName, byType, and primary

Bean lifecycle and dependency management

Ambiguity resolution in multi-bean environments
