I. Project Overview
Goal
To build a simple e-commerce website using the Spring Framework.

Not intended to be a full-scale e-commerce solution like Amazon.

Focus is on core backend features, demonstrating practical Spring concepts through a real-world application.

Planned Functionality
The project will implement essential features such as:

Viewing products: Users can see a list of available products, including:

Images

Descriptions

Prices

Viewing product details: Clicking a product shows more info.

Updating product descriptions.

Deleting products.

Sorting products by category.

Adding products to a cart (implied, mentioned subtly).

Searching products: Mentioned as a future enhancement, not in the initial scope.

Technology Stack
Backend: Built with the Spring Framework.

Frontend: Basic UI using React (present, but not the focus).

REST clients (like Postman) are welcomed as frontend alternatives for testing APIs.

Development Approach
The application will be built in incremental stages.

Each video/tutorial introduces a new Spring concept and directly applies it to the project.

Emphasis is on hands-on learning, rather than theoretical discussion.

II. Project Visuals and UI
UI Mockup
A basic mockup of the product listing and details page is shown.

Intended to give viewers an idea of how the site might look.

UI design is kept intentionally simple to keep focus on backend development.

Call for Design Contributions
Presenter invites UI/UX designers or frontend developers in the audience to contribute.
