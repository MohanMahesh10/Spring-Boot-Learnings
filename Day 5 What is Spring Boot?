Key Takeaways: Spring Boot Overview
Purpose: Spring Boot simplifies Spring application development by minimizing configuration and setup.

Problem Solved: Traditional Spring requires extensive configuration and server setup (like Tomcat), which can be slow and complex.

Solution: Spring Boot offers:

Auto-configuration

Embedded servers (e.g., Tomcat)

Faster development cycle

Tool Highlight:

start.spring.io is a quick way to bootstrap a Spring Boot project.

Generates a pre-configured project with dependencies like Spring Web, Jackson, and embedded Tomcat.

Hello World Demo:

Created a simple REST controller with @RestController and @GetMapping.

Ran the app directly using the embedded Tomcat server (default port 8080).

Advantages:

Rapid setup and execution.

Simplifies Java backend development.

Great for prototyping and small projects.

Disadvantages:

Opinionated defaults may include unnecessary dependencies.

Customization beyond the defaults can be more complex.

Conclusion: Spring Boot builds on Spring Framework to streamline app creation. Best for developers who value speed and simplicity over fine-grained control.
